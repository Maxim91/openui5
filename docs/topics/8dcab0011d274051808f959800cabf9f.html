			and types. You define the set of properties your control provides as well as events or
			aggregations. A major task is the implementation of a control-specific renderer, which
			knows how to create suitable HTML markup for a given control instance, taking its
			current state into account. A renderer is written in JavaScript and produces HTML output
			which is styled by means of CSS. Such style sheets are another important part of a UI
			library.</p><p>Controls can be defined on the fly without a library definition or running generation
			steps. These controls are also called <dnf>notepad controls</dnf>.</p><p>When you want to develop several controls for reuse in different applications, we
			recommend creating a control library instead of using these notepad controls. Control
			libraries have additional features such as automatic support for theming and
			right-to-left languages, but the implementation of the controls is the same as for
			notepad controls.</p><div class="note   "><div class="collapsible-icon sap-icon"><div class="title"><strong>
