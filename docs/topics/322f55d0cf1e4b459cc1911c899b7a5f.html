			<h2 class="title ">Understanding Accessibility</h2>
			<p>Accessibility refers to the possibility for everyone, including and especially people
				who are differently-abled, to access and use information technology products. It is
				a guiding principle in OpenUI5 design and
				development processes and integral part of the framework.</p>
			<p>Accessibility is incorporated at two levels: framework and application level. Many
				features are available on the framework level and provided to app developers out of
				the box, which ensures consistency across all products. Some features need to be
				added or adapted according to the app-specific context and need to be considered
				when developing your app.</p>
			<p>Depending on your use case please refer to the corresponding accessibility chapter in
				the Developing Controls or Developing Apps sections in DemoKit.</p>

				Building Blocks</h2>
			<p>
				</p><ul class="ul ">
					<li class="li">
						<p>Markup (correct HTML): When developing accessible applications, you need
							to pay attention to the correctness of the resulting HTML. Some vital
							accessibility features (screen reader and keyboard support) rely on a
							correct and meaningful structure of the application.</p>
					</li>
					<li class="li">ARIA attribute: Accessible Rich Internet Applications (ARIA) is a set of
						attributes that define ways to make web content and applications more
						accessible to people with disabilities who use assistive technologies. </li>
					<li class="li">Keyboard handling: Keyboard handling enables users to access every UI
						element of the application with the keyboard.</li>
					<li class="li">Screen reader: A screen reader is a software application that identifies and
						interprets textual content on the UI. Developers need to know how the screen
						reader reads out the contents of the UI. </li>
					<li class="li">Contrast: The different colors shown on the UI need to have a good contrast
						to each other, in order to be easily distinguishable.</li>
					<li class="li">Resizing: Developers should always consider the fact that the application
						could be zoomed to 200%, and everything should still be visible.</li>
					<li class="li">APIs: The framework provides APIs to help app developers improve the
						accessibility in the context of their application. </li>
