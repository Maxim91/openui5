			allow data editing on the UI.</p><p>For data binding, you need a model and a binding instance: The model instance holds the
			data and provides methods to set the data or to retrieve the data from a server. It also
			provides a method for creating bindings to the data. When this method is called, a
			binding instance is created, which contains the binding information and provides an
			event, which is fired whenever the bound data changes. An element can listen to this
			event and update its visualization according to the new data.</p><p>The UI uses data binding to bind controls to the model which holds the application data,
			so that the controls are updated automatically whenever application data changes. Data
			binding is also used the other way round, when changes in the control cause updates in
			the underlying application data, for example data entered by the user. This is called
			two-way binding.</p><section>

The properties within JSON and OData models almost always are arranged in a hierarchical structure. Therefore, we should take a look at how to reference fields in a hierarchically structured model object." class="sap-doc">Step 8: Binding Paths: Accessing Properties in Hierarchically Structured Models</a></li><li><a href="#/topic/6fdf0acd0bc24ffdad327cf7e6f9e7e0.html" title="We also want to provide our users a way of contacting Harry Hawk.

These data types can then be applied to controls in order to ensure that the value presented on the screen is formatted correctly, and, if the field is open for input, that the value entered by the user adheres to the requirements of that data type. We will now add a new field called Sales Amount of type Currency." class="sap-doc">Step 10: Property Formatting Using Data Types</a></li><li><a href="#/topic/b8c4e534cdb440e9a5bbff86f9572bd6.html" title="So far, we have created a currency field that can format itself correctly. The currency data type also has the ability to validate that user input adheres to to the requirements of a currency; however, data type validation functions are managed by OpenUI5, which of itself has no mechanism for reporting error messages back to the UI; therefore, we need a mechanism for reporting error messages raised by validation functions back to the user. In this step, we will connect the entire view to a feature known as the &quot;Message Manager&quot;. Once this connection is established, any validation error messages generated based on the user input will be passed to the message manager which in turn will connect them to the appropriate view and control that caused the error." class="sap-doc">Step 11: Validation Using the Message Manager</a></li><li><a href="#/topic/97830de2d7314e93b5c1ee3878a17be9.html" title="Aggregation binding (or &quot;list binding&quot;) allows a control to be bound to a list within the model data and allows relative binding to the list entries by its child controls." class="sap-doc">Step 12: Aggregation Binding Using Templates</a></li><li><a href="#/topic/6c7c5c266b534e7ea9a28f861dc515f5.html" title="Now we want to do something with that newly generated list.
