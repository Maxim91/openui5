			<h2 class="title ">Downloading Code for a Tutorial Step</h2>
			<p>To download the code from the Demo Kit, follow these steps:</p><ol>
					<li class="li">
						<p>Choose the link in the <span class="ph uicontrol">Coding</span> section of the tutorial step you want to work on or find the code in the <span class="ph uicontrol">Samples</span> section of the Demo Kit (filter by "<span class="ph uicontrol">Tutorial</span>" to get a list of the tutorials that are available).</p>
					</li>
					<li class="li">
						<p>Choose the icon with the <span class="ph uicontrol">Show source code for this
								sample</span> tooltip in the right-hand part of the header bar
							to display all files included in this sample.</p>
					</li>
					<li class="li">
						<p>Choose the <span class="ph uicontrol">Download</span> button. A <code>zip</code> file is
							downloaded to your local machine.</p>
					</li>
					<li class="li"><p>Extract or upload the <code>zip</code> file to your development environment.</p></li><li class="li"><p>Adjust the project configuration files to match your development environment as described
							below.</p></li><li class="li"><p>Test the project by calling one of the HTML pages in your development environment and make sure that the app is displaying the features exactly as shown in the preview of the step. </p></li>
				</ol><p></p>
		</section><section id="tutorials_adaptation">
			<h2 class="title ">Adapting Code to Your Development Environment</h2>
			<p>You might have to adapt parts of the coding to your local development environment to
				make the app work. Please check the following settings carefully:</p><ul class="ul ">
					<li class="li">
						<p><span class="emphasis">Project Path and Deployment</span></p>
						<p>All tutorials assume that the app is deployed and can be accessed under a certain path on a
							web server. You will not be able to run the app without a Web server as
							the browser does not allow you to load the required resources locally
							due to security restrictions.</p>
					</li>
					<li class="li">
						<p><span class="emphasis">OpenUI5
								Resources</span></p>
						<p>You can either download and deploy the runtime to your (local) Web server or reference the CDN version located at <code>https://sdk.openui5.org/resources/sap-ui-core.js</code>. Some development environments such as the
								SAP Web IDE also provide a local runtime for testing purposes. If
							you download the code from the samples in the Demo Kit, you will have to adapt the <span class="emphasis">resource path in the
								bootstrap section</span> of all HTML pages included in the project. In the tutorial code, we assume that OpenUI5 can be accessed from the <code>/resources</code>
							path of the server.</p>
					</li>
					<li class="li">
						<p><span class="emphasis">Accessing Remote Services</span></p>
						<p>Browsers typically prevent accessing remote resources due to the
							Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) policy. If you would like to call a
							real service or remote resources, you will have to either configure the
							development environment or the remote server to accept these requests.
							This strongly depends on the development environment and is described in
							more detail below.</p>
