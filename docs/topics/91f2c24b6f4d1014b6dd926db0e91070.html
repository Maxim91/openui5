		right-to-left directionality (RTL) in controls.</div><p>Unicode defines the direction in which a browser arranges characters to form words. CSS 2.1
			also provides a <code>direction</code> property. The <code>dir</code> attribute
			in HTML overrides the overall direction of blocks and influences the text alignment, if
			not set explicitly. The <code>lang</code> attribute does <span class="emphasis">not</span>
			influence the text direction.</p><p>It is possible to use <code>document.dir</code> for text direction. The browser supports it
			and it can be set in the bootstrap. The <code>&lt;bdo&gt;</code> tag in HTML is used
			to control the bidirectional algorithm. This means that the character order is then not
			reversed if RTL and LTR words are mixed.</p><p>In a nutshell, this means the following: </p><ul class="ul ">
			<li class="li">
				<p>Each character inherently belongs to an RTL or LTR script (defined by Unicode). Some
					characters like parentheses and dots have no inherent directionality. </p>
			</li>
			<li class="li">
				<p>Single words are interpreted by the browser as character sequences with the same
					directionality. For these, the browser knows the text direction and handles them
					as blocks that get their internal text direction <b>only</b> from the used
					characters.</p>
			</li>
			<li class="li">
				<p>The words themselves are separated by the direction-neutral characters like parentheses,
					spaces and dots. This makes it possible for a single sentence
					to contain words with either directionality. </p><div class="note   "><div class="collapsible-icon sap-icon"><div class="title"><strong>
					Note
				</strong></div></div><div class="fig"><p>
						</p><p>This behavior can be overridden by using the <code>&lt;bdo&gt;</code> tag or CSS
								<code>unicode-bidi:bidi-override</code>. This is done when the
							order of characters must follow the base direction regardless of the
							inherent character direction. </p>
					<p></p></div></div><p></p>
			</li>
			<li class="li">
				<p>The overall direction and how the blocks are put next to each other depends on the base
					direction of the whole HTML content.</p>
			</li>
			<li class="li">
				<p>The default base direction of HTML is left-to-right (LTR), but can be inverted by setting the
					attribute <code>"dir='rtl'"</code>, either on the
						<code>&lt;html&gt;</code> tag or on any sub-region which should have a
					different base direction.</p>
			</li>
			<li class="li">
				<p>This base direction also determines the default text alignment, the order of columns in
					tables and the presentation of some direction-neutral characters. For example,
					opening parentheses are still opening parentheses when RTL mode is switched. </p>
			</li>
			<li class="li">
				<p>The algorithm for ordering blocks according to the base direction only covers one level of
					mixed directionality. To achieve deeper nesting, spans with a
						<code>dir</code> attribute can be used to define a sub-context with a
					different base direction. </p>

			<h2 class="title ">General Algorithm</h2>
			<p>If OpenUI5 is configured for RTL
				mode, the OpenUI5 core
				performs the following steps:</p>
			<ol>
				<li class="li">
					<p><code>dir="rtl"</code> is set  on the HTML tag.</p>
					<div class="note   "><div class="collapsible-icon sap-icon"><div class="title"><strong>
					Note
				</strong></div></div><div class="fig"><p>
						</p><p>The W3C officially recommends using the HTML attribute instead of the CSS properties as
							directionality is determined by content and has nothing to do with the
							presentation. Another reason is that CSS properties can be ignored. They
							also recommend using the <code>&lt;HTML&gt;</code> tag instead of
							the <code>&lt;BODY&gt;</code> tag.</p>
					<p></p></div></div>
				</li>
				<li class="li">
					<p>The respective <code>library-RTL.css</code> files are loaded.</p>
				</li>
				<li class="li">
					<p>The CSS generator includes an RTL flipping algorithm. This algorithm performs the following
							changes:</p><ul class="ul ">
							<li class="li">
								<p><code>border-left:</code> is converted to<code>
										border-right:</code>, <code>padding-left:</code> is
									converted to <code>padding-right:</code>,
										<code>float:left</code> is converted to
										<code>float:right</code> and so on. </p>
							</li>
							<li class="li">
								<p>If the <code>img-RTL</code> folder contains any images, their URL paths inside the <code>library-RTL.css</code> file are rewritten
									as they are considered to be mirrored versions of images with the same name in the <code>img</code>
									folder.</p>
								<p>
									</p><div class="note   "><div class="collapsible-icon sap-icon"><div class="title"><strong>
					Note
				</strong></div></div><div class="fig"><p>
										</p><p>If images need to be mirrored, you need to manually provide the correct RTL version of the image and save
											it under the same name in the corresponding subfolder within the <code>img-RTL</code> folder.
											Otherwise, ensure that the folder contains no image with the same name.</p>
