				<i>Model-View-Controller</i> and establish a best-practice structure of our
			application. We'll do this along the classic example of “Hello World” and start a new
			app from scratch. Next, we'll introduce the fundamental data binding concepts of OpenUI5 and extend our app
			to show a list of invoices. We'll continue to add more functionality by adding
			navigation, extending controls, and making our app responsive.Finally we'll look at the
			testing features and the built-in support tools of OpenUI5.</p><section>
