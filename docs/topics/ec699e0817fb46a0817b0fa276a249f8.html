			<h2 class="title ">OpenUI5
				Architecture</h2>
			<div><div class="fig"><img src="SAPUI5_Architecture_Overview_99b4be7.png" usemap="#"></div></div>
			<p>OpenUI5 is a client UI
				technology based on JavaScript, CSS and HTML5. </p>
			<p>Apps developed with OpenUI5 run in a browser on any device (mobile, tablet or desktop PC). </p>
			<p>When users access an OpenUI5 app, a request
				is sent to the respective server to load the application into the browser. The view
				accesses the relevant libraries. Usually the model is also instantiated and business
				data is fetched from the database.</p>
			<p>Depending on the environment in which OpenUI5 is used, the
				libraries or your applications can be stored, for example, on an SAP NetWeaver Application
                            Server or an SAP Business Technology Platform, and business
				data can be accessed, for example, using the OData model through a SAP Gateway.</p>

			<h2 class="title ">Artifacts in the Framework</h2>
			<p>The top-level structural unit is called a <span class="emphasis">library</span>. Libraries are the master artifacts in the extensibility concept. They
				bundle a set of controls and related types and make them consumable by Web applications. There are predefined and standard libraries, like
					<code>sap.m</code>, with many commonly used controls. At the same time, it treats custom UI libraries as first-class citizens, making it
				easy for you to write and use your own controls alongside the predefined ones.</p>
			<p>A UI <span class="emphasis">element</span> is the basic building block of our user interfaces; it is a reusable entity with properties, events, methods,
				and relations. The most important relations are aggregations to other UI elements, and in this way a tree structure of elements can be
				created.</p>
			<p>From a developer's point of view, a <span class="emphasis">control</span> (e.g. <code>Button</code>, <code>Label</code>,
					<code>TextField</code>, or <code>Table</code>) is the most important artifact. It is an object which controls the appearance and
				user interaction of a rectangular screen region. It is a special kind of user interface element which can be used as the root of such a tree
				structure. In this way, it serves as an entry point, especially for rendering. Besides controls, there are also other <span class="emphasis">non-control
					elements</span>, which cannot be used as the root of such a tree structure, but only as a dependent part within it (e.g.
					<code>TableRow</code>, <code>TableCell</code>).</p>
			<p><span class="emphasis">Data types</span> are first-class entities in the meta model. This allows reuse of types across libraries and extensibility of the
				type system. The core library (technically, this is the <code>sap.ui.core</code> library) already defines a core set of types that can be
				used in other libraries.</p>
